:gf:Dracobot!
:bf:Be-bop!
:dad:Girlfriend. Boyfriend. Thank you... A little bit longer and I would have to resort to...
:dad:something more drastic...
:gf:We're glad you're okay! I am so sorry about what happened back there. It's my fault for throwing it away in the first place.
:dad:No no. It's okay. It's my fault for being nosey and naive. hehehe...

:dad:Just do me a favor...
:dad:And please keep that disc somewhere safe next time...
:gf:Honestly, it'd be safer if you were to keep it.
:gf:Maybe like contain him somewhere where he won't hurt anyone.

:dad:That's honestly a good idea.
:dad:I'll talk to my creator about this.
:dad:Maybe make it so that we can communicate with him and probably convince him to not do this again.
:dad:And maybe we can give him his own body just like how my creator did to me and my twin sister.
:gf:Oh sweet! Though it's best to keep an eye on him just in case he does a reverse uno card on you.
:dad:Don't worry. My creator will make sure of it.
:dad:I'll also ask her to make this body harder for it be possessed by other spirits.
:bf:Beb. Bo-be-bap!
:dad:You wanna do one more song?
:dad:Hahaha! Sure! Consider this a thank you from me.
:dad:Though, I might have to go recharge myself after all of that.
:dad:Again, thank you so much for saving me. I owe you big time.
:bf:beep!
:dad:I won't go easy on you this time!
:dad:Cuz this song's difficulty is the same across the board!
:dad:But knowing how you handled spirit, you can handle it!
:bf:Be ba boop bap!
:gf:Go get him Boyfriend!
:dad:Now show me and your girlfriend whatcha got!
