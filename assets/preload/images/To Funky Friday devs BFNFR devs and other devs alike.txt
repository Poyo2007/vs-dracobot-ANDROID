To the Funky Friday Devs, the BFNF:R Devs, and other devs alike, if you wish to add the VS Dracobot mod,
you are more than welcome to add the VS Dracobot mod into your desired game, especially when it comes
to Funky Friday and BFNF:R since that I am a fan of your respective games.
This also applies to other FNF multiplayer games seen in Roblox as well as other games like it that
i may not be aware of.
If you still want to ask just to make sure, my Discord is Dracobot#5488.
Don't be shy.
