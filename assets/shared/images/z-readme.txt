I am completely fine with fanart of the characters in the VS Dracobot mod.
I do not care if it is SFW or explicit. SFW is prefered though.
The only exception to this is regarding explicit art involving the character, Olevadon.
I only ask of you to NOT make any explicit fanart of Olevadon since he's technically still underaged.
SFW art of Olevadon is completely okay.
Just no explicit art of Olevadon, okay? If I do find explicit art of Olevadon somewhere, I will kindly ask you to take it down.
