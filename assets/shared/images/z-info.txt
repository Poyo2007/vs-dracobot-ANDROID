Dracobot is a huge vocaloid fan and he's unaware that Boyfriend is related to Hatsune Miku. (Though if he did find out, Dracobot will lose his mind.)
Dracobot can run Doom and other games as well. He's kinda like a walking arcade machine. He even plays some games on his arm which shows a little screen for the games he has on him.
